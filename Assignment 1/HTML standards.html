<h2>Some Quotes</h2>

 <strong>– Gildarts Clive <em>(Fairy Tail)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>Every day, think as you wake up, today I am fortunate to be alive, I have a precious human life, I am not going to waste it. I am going to use all my energies to develop myself, to expand my heart out to others; to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings. I am going to have kind thoughts towards others, I am not going to get angry or think badly about others. I am going to benefit others as much as I can.</em> <strong>Dalai Lama</strong>
</p>
<p>“To know sorrow is not terrifying. What is terrifying is to know you can’t go back to happiness you could have.”
<strong>– Matsumoto Rangiku <em>(Bleach)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“Knowing you’re different is only the beginning. If you accept these differences you’ll be able to get past them and grow even closer.”
<strong>– Miss Kobayashi <em>(Dragon Maid)</em></strong>

<p>“Don’t be so quick to throw away your life. No matter how disgraceful or embarrassing it may be, you need to keep struggling to find your way out until the very end.”

</p>
<p>“The world’s not perfect, but it’s there for us trying the best it can. That’s what makes it so damn beautiful.”
 <strong>– Roy Mustang <em>(Fullmetal Alchemist)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>We have three roles here on earth:<strong> to learn, to love, and to live</strong>. When we stop learning, we start to <em>stagnate and die</em>. When we stop loving, we lose our sense of purpose and become self-centered. When we limit our living, we deny the world the benefits of our talents. Jim Cathcart, The Acorn Principle
</p>
<p><strong>“We are all like fireworks: we climb, we shine and always go our separate ways and become further apart. But even when that time comes, let’s not disappear like a firework and continue to shine.. forever.”</strong>
–<em> Hitsugaya Toshiro</em><strong> (Bleach)</strong>
</p>
<p>“If nobody cares to accept you and wants you in this world, accept yourself and you will see that you don’t need them and their selfish ideas.”
<strong>– Alibaba Saluja <em>(Magi)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“When you hit the point of no return, that’s the moment it truly becomes a journey. If you can still turn back, it’s not really a journey.”
<strong>– Hinata Miyake <em>(A Place Further than the Universe)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Life is a gamble</strong> from minute to minute so play it today for all there is in it. The flick of an eye lash, the quirk of a smile. <strong>A good deed here and there makes it all worthwhile</strong>. <em>So make life a garden for everyday and gather your rosebudes while you may</em>. P. MacDonald</p>
<p>
“Those who stand at the top determine what’s wrong and what’s right! This very place is neutral ground! Justice will prevail, you say? But of course it will! Whoever wins this war becomes justice!”
<strong>– Don Quixote Doflamingo <em>(One Piece)</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“A person grows up when he’s able to overcome hardships. Protection is important, but there are some things that a person must learn on his own.“</em>
<strong>– Jiraiya</strong><em> (Naruto)</em>
</p>
<p>“Religion, ideology, resources, land, spite, love or just because… No matter how pathetic the reason, it’s enough to start a war. War will never cease to exist… reasons can be thought up after the fact…<strong> Human nature pursues strife.</strong>”
– <em>Paine</em> (Naruto Shippuden)
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>“Don’t be upset because of what you can’t do. Do what you do best, live as carefree and optimistically as you can, because some people aren’t able to do that.”
– Keima Katsuragi </em>(The World God Only Knows)</strong>
