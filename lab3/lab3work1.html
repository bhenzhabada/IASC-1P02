			<h1 id="firstHeader">Exotic Animals</h1>

			<p class="greenText">A pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment rather than as a working animal, livestock or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive appearances, intelligence and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray animal) and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.
			</p>
			<p class="greenText">The definition of exotic pet may change from person to person and organization to organization.  Often “exotic” pets which are quite common and established may be considered exotic by some definitions.  One of the simplest definitions in common use is an exotic pet is anything other than a cat or a dog and not livestock.
